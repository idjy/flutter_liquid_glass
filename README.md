## Introduction

Liquid glass effects can enhance the visual appeal of applications, making them feel modern and interactive. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive solution for implementing these effects using Flutter. The goal is to create a library that is easy to use and integrate into any Flutter project.

## Features

- **Customizable Glass Effect**: Easily modify properties to fit your design.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on various screen sizes.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on app performance.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with both iOS and Android.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate and use.

## Getting Started

To get started with Flutter Liquid Glass, you need to have Flutter installed on your machine. If you haven't done this yet, follow the [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- An IDE (like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio)

## Installation

You can add the Flutter Liquid Glass package to your project by including it in your `pubspec.yaml` file. Hereâ€™s how:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_liquid_glass: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run the following command to install it:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage

To use the liquid glass effect in your Flutter application, import the package and implement it in your widget tree. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_liquid_glass/flutter_liquid_glass.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: LiquidGlass(
            height: 200,
            width: 300,
            child: Center(child: Text('Hello, Liquid Glass!')),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple application with a liquid glass effect. You can customize the height, width, and child widget to fit your needs.
